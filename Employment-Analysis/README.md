# Tourism Employment Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes employment in tourism-related industries across different countries using Python. The dataset provides employment figures per 1,000 people, allowing for comparative analysis across countries.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is `2- number-of-individuals-employed-in-tourism-related-industries-per-1000-people.csv` placed in a `data` directory within the repository.  It contains information on employment statistics for tourism-related industries, covering multiple years and countries.  The original dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/tourism).


## Analysis Steps
- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values and inspected dataset structure.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Computed mean, median, and standard deviation of employment per 1,000 people.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Identified top, middle, and bottom countries based on employment levels.
- **Visualization**: Created a bar chart showing employment distribution among selected countries.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating time-series analysis to examine trends over the years.
- Comparing employment rates with tourism revenue data for deeper insights.
- Analyzing the impact of external factors such as economic downturns or pandemics.
