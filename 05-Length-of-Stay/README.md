## Analysis of Average Length of Stay
This project analyzes the average length of stay of tourists across different countries over time. The analysis explores patterns, distributions, and trends using data visualization techniques.
Additionally, a Streamlit dashboard has been developed to provide interactive data exploration.

### Data
```10-average-length-of-stay.csv```: The dataset containing information on the average length of stay per country and year. Data placed in a `data` directory within the repository and the original dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/tourism).

### Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examining dataset structure, missing values, and statistical summaries.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing and inconsistent values.
- **Distribution Analysis:** Visualizing the frequency of different stay durations.
- **Trend Analysis:** Evaluating year-over-year changes in the average length of stay.
- **Country Comparisons:** Identifying which countries have the longest and shortest tourist stays.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit for dynamic data exploration.
