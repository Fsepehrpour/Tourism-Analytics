# Hotel Performance Dashboard

This project explores hotel reservation data through interactive visualizations using **Streamlit** and **Tableau Public**. The goal is to uncover key insights about customer behavior, booking trends, and cancellation patterns in a clear and engaging way.

## Project Summary

Using a dataset of hotel reservations, this dashboard provides:

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** like total bookings, cancellation rate, average room price, lead time, and guest repetition rate.
- **Interactive charts** to explore:
  - Booking status (Confirmed vs. Canceled)
  - Cancellation rate by market segment
  - Monthly booking trends
  - Room price distribution per market segment

The project is built with **Python**, **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **Streamlit** for the interactive dashboard, and **Tableau Public** for a polished visual storytelling experience.
