This script is a practice of regression models to predict missing values based on other features. 

1. **Understand the Data**
    - Identify the relationship between 'Monthly CO₂ emissions from domestic aviation' and other features such as 'Monthly CO₂ emissions from international aviation', 'Day', or any other relevant variables.
    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize correlations or trends.

2. **Preprocess Your Data**
    - **Separate Features and Target**: Use the available rows (non-missing values) of 'Monthly CO₂ emissions from domestic aviation' as your target variable (y) and other features as predictors (X).
    - **Handle Other Missing Values**: Address missing values in the predictors (X). For instance:
        - Use mean, median, or mode imputation for numerical features.
        - Use forward-fill or backward-fill methods for temporal features like Day.

3. **Train a Regression Model**
    - Select a regression model such as **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree Regressor**, **Random Forest Regressor**, or **Gradient Boosting** (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM).
    - Split the non-missing data into training and validation sets.
    - Train the model using the training set and evaluate its performance on the validation set using metrics like R² or RMSE.

4. **Predict Missing Values**
    - Use the trained model to predict the missing values for Monthly CO₂ emissions from domestic aviation.
    - Replace the missing values in your dataset with the predicted values.
